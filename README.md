when using render with partials is it bad to pass instance variables as stated in the blog post:"Using instance variables in partials complicates the control flow, which facilitates bugs and makes reuse of partials more difficult".. however on the active record documentation:
        http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/PartialRenderer.html
    the examples given pass instance variables and objects in locals.. which is correct???

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
